# Hobbies

- **Dancing:** Dancing is one of my favorite ways to stay active and creative. Whether it's salsa, hip-hop, or contemporary, I enjoy learning new styles and expressing myself through movement. It helps me stay energized and brings a sense of balance to my life.

- **Reading:** I am passionate about reading, particularly in the areas of technology, science fiction, and personal development. I find that reading broadens my perspective and introduces me to new ideas that often inspire my approach to both life and work.

- **Coding Challenges:** As a developer, I enjoy participating in coding challenges and hackathons. These activities allow me to push the boundaries of my problem-solving abilities and explore new technologies in a fun and competitive environment. It also helps me stay sharp and continuously improve my coding skills.

- **Gaming:** Iâ€™m an avid gamer, and I find that playing video games not only serves as a way to relax but also enhances my strategic thinking and reflexes. I enjoy both single-player story-driven games as well as competitive multiplayer games, which also nurture my ability to work in teams and adapt to fast-paced environments.

- **Photography:** Capturing moments through photography is another hobby I am passionate about. I enjoy exploring different perspectives, experimenting with light, and finding beauty in everyday life. Photography allows me to disconnect and tap into my creative side.

- **Traveling:** Exploring new cultures and environments is something I truly value. Traveling expands my worldview, introduces me to new ideas and traditions, and inspires creativity in both my personal and professional life. I enjoy planning trips to both cities and nature destinations, always looking for new experiences.
